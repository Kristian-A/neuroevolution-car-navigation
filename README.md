# Neuroevolution Car Navigation

This project aimed to develop a Neural Network capable of efficiently controlling a car to navigate around a map and reach a specified end goal. It features an integration of Unity and C#, where the Neural Network is meticulously developed and trained from the ground up. The project employs a Genetic Algorithm that generates multiple, diverse Neural Networks. These networks are subjected to a Darwinian Evolution-inspired selection process, where the most effective networks are algorithmically cross-bred to create successive generations.
